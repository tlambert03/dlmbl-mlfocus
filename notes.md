<!-- - make better logs wandb -->
<!-- - hold certain samples out entirely from training -->

- implement local connection (non-resnet on FFT data)

- two more training runs:
    - remove simplest modality (i.e. beads), train on all the rest, test
    <!-- - hold out the hardest ... (i.e. blurry shit) -->


- try training on only beads ... holding out just one bead
